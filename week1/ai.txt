Prompt:
Why is my if-statement not working? I'm running a bash script with set -euxo pipefail. When it gets to the if-statement if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]] ; then sum=$sum+${line%%(^[0..9]+ )}; echo ${line%%(^[0..9]+ )} ; fi it prints + [[ 19 636 =~ ^[0..9]+ [0..9]+ ]] but then doesn't execute the associated then-statement. Why is it not working?
ChatGPT Response:
The issue lies in your use of [0..9] inside the regular expression. That is not valid syntax for a character class in Bash regex.

🔍 Breakdown of the Problem
Your code:
if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    sum=$sum+${line%%(^[0..9]+ )};
    echo ${line%%(^[0..9]+ )};
fi

Output:
+ [[ 19 636 =~ ^[0..9]+ [0..9]+ ]]

Why it's not working:

[[ ... =~ ... ]] in Bash uses extended regular expressions (ERE).

In ERE, a character class for digits is written as [0-9], not [0..9].

[0..9] is interpreted literally, as the characters 0, ., . and 9, which do not match digits in the way you expect.

So the regex does not match the line, and the then clause does not run.

✅ Fix

Update your pattern to use a valid regex:

line_pattern='^[0-9]+ [0-9]+'


Make sure it's quoted, and use [0-9] instead of [0..9].

Fixed version of your if-statement:
line_pattern='^[0-9]+ [0-9]+'

if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    sum=$((sum + ${line%% *}))  # extract the first number and add it to sum
    echo "${line%% *}"          # print the first number
fi


Also, for arithmetic, use $((...)) instead of sum=$sum+.... That was also incorrect syntax in Bash.

💡 What does ${line%% *} do?

${line%% *} removes everything after the first space (and the space itself).

So if line="19 636", ${line%% *} returns 19.

✅ Final Working Snippet
#!/bin/bash
set -euxo pipefail

sum=0
line="19 636"
line_pattern='^[0-9]+ [0-9]+'

if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    value=${line%% *}
    sum=$((sum + value))
    echo "$value"
fi

echo "Sum is $sum"


This will print:

+ [[ 19 636 =~ ^[0-9]+ [0-9]+ ]]
+ value=19
+ sum=19
+ echo 19
19
+ echo Sum is 19
Sum is 19


Let me know if your actual input format is more complex.


Prompt:
That fixed the problem, but what if I want the second number to be added to sum instead of the first

ChatGPT Response:
Great — glad that fixed it!

If you want to extract the second number from a line like:

19 636


…and add 636 to sum, there are a few clean ways to do it.

✅ Option 1: Use awk (easy and reliable)
if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    value=$(awk '{print $2}' <<< "$line")
    sum=$((sum + value))
    echo "$value"
fi


This prints the second field in the line using whitespace as the delimiter.

✅ Option 2: Use Bash string manipulation

If you'd rather avoid subprocesses like awk, you can split the string using read:

if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    read -r first second <<< "$line"
    sum=$((sum + second))
    echo "$second"
fi


This assigns first=19, second=636.

read is very efficient and idiomatic in Bash.

✅ Option 3: Use cut

Another external tool approach:

value=$(cut -d' ' -f2 <<< "$line")
sum=$((sum + value))
echo "$value"

Final Sample Script
#!/bin/bash
set -euxo pipefail

sum=0
line="19 636"
line_pattern='^[0-9]+ [0-9]+'

if [[ $line =~ $line_pattern ]]; then
    read -r first second <<< "$line"
    sum=$((sum + second))
    echo "$second"
fi

echo "Sum is $sum"


Output:

+ [[ 19 636 =~ ^[0-9]+ [0-9]+ ]]
+ read -r first second
+ sum=636
+ echo 636
636
+ echo Sum is 636
Sum is 636


Let me know if the line has more complex formatting or multiple spaces — I can adjust accordingly.
